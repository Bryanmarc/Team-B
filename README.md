## Getting Started ##
So you are probably overwhelmed by everything right now. It is **okay** to be intimidated or confused. This resource is supposed to help you out as much as possible to learn about everything necessary to program your robot.
### 1. Chose Programming Software
VEX has a lot of resources when it comes to making code for your robot. Which software you chose does not matter for getting your robot moving. However, if you want to fully control every feature of the robot the way you want you will probably have to dive into the more advanced side of programming. This list will feature the pros and cons of each software.

## VEX Programming Dictionary
*(Most of these definitions are from Google)*

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** - An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. *(Wikipedia)*

**VexOS** - The operating system behind the Cortex and Brain.

#### Questions about VEX Programming
I'd recommend checking out the [Unofficial VEX Discord](https://discord.gg/xddjWGj) for specific questions Google can't answer. You can also ask on [VEX Forum](vexforum.com). But I recommend the Discord server more, you get replies faster and they will help you step-by-step typically.
