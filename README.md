# Team 3273 Programming Resource
Hey there, hopefully this guide will help you learn the basics behind programming for VEX Robotics. I created this guide to help those willing to program even while I'm not there to help Team 3273 in person. I will do my best to help you understand everything quickly. This is a guide and a resource. Don't be scared to come back to this if you need some help.

## Getting Started ##
So you are probably overwhelmed by everything right now. It is **okay** to be intimidated or confused. This resource is supposed to help you out as much as possible to learn about everything necessary to program your robot.
### 1. Chose Programming Software
VEX has a lot of resources when it comes to making code for your robot. Which software you chose does not matter for getting your robot moving. However, if you want to fully control every feature of the robot the way you want you will probably have to dive into the more advanced side of programming. This list will feature the pros and cons of each software.
